This sketch of a mirror represents the basic idea of a mirror. The main component of this mirror is the user. On the left side of the screen, you can see the date, events, health information, temperature, and weather of the day. Top technological news can be viewed on the top right side of the screen. The health table includes information on my weight(s) and exercise. In addition to the current temperature, the temperature includes what it feels like.
