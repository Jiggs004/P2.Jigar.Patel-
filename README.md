This sketch of a mirror represents the basic idea of a mirror. The main component of this mirror is the user. On the left side of the screen, you can see the date, events, health information, temperature, and weather of the day. Top technological news can be viewed on the top right side of the screen. The health table includes information on my weight(s) and exercise. In addition to the current temperature, the temperature includes what it feels like.

The final mirror has seen changes added to it. The sketch of the mirror was a very good starting point to get a reasonable understanding of the design and how it should be implemented it. The most information displayed on the webcam screen is in the events and health groups. For weather, I did not include temperatures for the entire week that's coming up. I did not have enough space to put temperatures for next 7 days so, i just decided to implement feels like and current temperature. My health includes my weights' progess and duration of workouts. At last, I searched the latest news about technology and found 3 inresting topics/stories.
